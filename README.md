## Data

- The sentences are fetched and parsed from [Perfume LOCKS](http://www.tfm.co.jp/lock/perfume/) web page. This is my [swift script](https://gist.github.com/yllan/45d09a72e66303798714) to fetch the data.
- The key icons are captured in Magic of Love [PV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhI2mp-WIck).
